{"context":"When compact discs first entered the market, they were priced significantly higher than vinyl records. Manufacturers attributed the difference in price to the difference in production costs, saying that compact disc production was expensive because the technology was new and unfamiliar. As the technology became more efficient, the price of the discs did indeed come down. But vinyl records, whose production technology has long been established, then went up in price to approach that of compact discs.","question":"Which one of the following most helps to explain why the price of vinyl records went up?","answers":["As consumers bought compact discs instead of vinyl records, the number of vinyl records produced decreased, making their production less cost-efficient.","Compact disc player technology continued to change and develop even after compact discs first entered the market.","Consumers were so enthusiastic about the improved sound quality offered by compact disc technology that they were willing to pay a higher price to obtain it.","Some consumers who continued to buy vinyl records instead of compact discs did so because they were unwilling to pay a higher price for compact discs."],"label":0,"id_string":"val_69","dataset_source":"ReClor"}
{"context":"Dead, rotting logs on the forest floor provide the habitat for a small mammal, the red-backed vole, which subsists almost entirely on the portion of certain specialized fungi which grows aboveground.

{"context":"Delta green ground beetles sometimes remain motionless for hours at a stretch, although they are more active in wet years than in dry years. In 1989 an observer spotted ten delta green ground beetles in nine hours; in 1985 the same observer at the same location had counted 38 in about two hours. This difference probably does not reflect a drop in the population of these rare beetles over this period, however, because 1985 was a wet year and 1989 was relatively dry.","question":"Which one of the following, if true, most strongly supports the conclusion drawn above?","answers":["No predator relies on the delta green ground beetle for a major portion of its food supply.","The only habitat of delta green ground beetles is around pools formed by the collection of winter rains in low-lying areas.","Because of their excellent camouflage, delta green ground beetles are almost impossible to see if they are not moving.","Delta green ground beetles move about very little to get food; most of their moving from one place to another is related to their reproductive behavior."],"label":2,"id_string":"val_154","dataset_source":"ReClor"}
